# Queue Data Structure in Java

This project implements a simple **Queue** using a **singly linked list** in Java.  
It includes the following operations:

- `enqueue()` – Add element to the rear  
- `dequeue()` – Remove element from the front  
- `display()` – Show the queue  
- `areEqual()` – Compare two queues node-by-node
